    TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    Fill in certificate fingerprint and package name in below URL.

    https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=maps_android_backend&keyType=CLIENT_SIDE_ANDROID&r=<cert_fingerprint>%3B<package_name>

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using the
    Package name and SHA-1 certificate fingerprint.

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.

        If you are getting the below error when running the app and Google Maps is not loading correctly
        (the application runs but the map itself is blank), then you may need to reconfigure the API
        key with a new SHA-1 certificate fingerprint. Additionally, ensure the necessary Google Maps
        APIs are enabled from the developer console. Check that the Google Play services versions
        are up to date. These are found in the application's gradle build file, not the entire project's
        gradle build file. Look in 'Project' view, <Project Name>/app/build.gradle and check that
        the versions are up to date.

        I received this error when moving my project from one dev machine to another.

        If you need to find the SHA-1 fingerprint for the project, follow these steps:
            1. Click on 'Gradle' on the right side panel.
            2. Right-click in blank space and select 'Refresh Gradle project'.
            3. Go to this location: <Project Name>/<Project Name> (root)/Tasks/android/
            4. Run 'signingReport' file (double-click).
            5. Output should be displayed in the 'Run' console window.
